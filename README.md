Impact of Technology on GDP Growth Analysis
📄 Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between technology indicators and GDP growth across 120 countries. Using real-world economic and technological data, the analysis investigates how technological adoption, innovation, and digital readiness influence national economic performance.
The repository contains:
* A CSV dataset with GDP and technology-related variables.
* A Jupyter Notebook where the full analysis, modelling, and visualization are carried out.

📂 Project Files
1. 120-countries_gdp_growth.csv
This dataset contains country-level metrics used for the analysis, such as:
* GDP growth rate
* Technology adoption indicators
* Broadband & mobile penetration
* Innovation indices
* Investment in technology
* Other socio-economic control variables
2. Impact_of_Technology_on_GDP_Growth.ipynb
This notebook includes:
* Data loading & cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Interpretation of how tech variables influence GDP growth
* Policy-oriented insights

🎯 Objectives of the Analysis
The goals of this study are to:
* Determine how technological advancement affects a country’s GDP growth.
* Identify which technology metrics have the strongest economic impact.
* Build statistical models to quantify these relationships.
* Provide data-driven policy recommendations for enhancing economic growth through technology.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
The notebook makes use of:
